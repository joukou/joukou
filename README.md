Joukou is a high level visual programming language for data that can be
deployed to a cloud environment and managed remotely via a web interface. Joukou
merges [flow-based programming](http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/) with
[BPMN 2.0](http://www.bpmn.org/). 

Joukou helps businesses to mobilise, synchronise, affiliate, and monetise their
data. Our vision is to liberate data from its confines and push the boundaries
of where data can be found and presented. We understand data as a continuous
flow and we strive to find the path of least resistance.
